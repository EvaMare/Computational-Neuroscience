Dear students 

The old computational neuroscience course has been split in two parts, this part (3EC),  which is more introductory and advanced computational neuroscience (6EC, next semester) that will cover topics based on current literature. For this part there are general background lecture notes,  i.e. the reader designed by Stan Gielen, which is uploaded under content. In addition, there will be lecture notes for each lecture that will be given, these are also uploaded, I will list in a message what is the relevant content for the upcoming lecture . In these lectures I will cover general nonlinear dynamics  and application to neural dynamics; population coding and information theory; firing rate, neural mass models and maps. 

The prerequisite for this course is neurophysics 1 & 2, if you do not meet this prerequisite  it may be useful to contact me.  In the past we waived this prerequisite for students enrolled in track 4 of the research master cognitive neuroscience (and the AI master). However, in the preceding years I have noticed that the math background and programming skills of some students in these programs was inadequate to follow this course, leading to student frustration. I have attached a self-assessment test to this message to help you decide if this course is for you.

There are practice hours included with this course, we will work to move this to a more palatable hour) with as teaching assistant Daria Mihaila (daria.mihaila@ru.nl). You are expected to hand in the homework — it works best if you do this within a week after assignment. To further encourage your  participation there is a bonus point for the practice hours, which is the average across the handed-in homework divided by 10 (i.e. if you hand in the homework for each session and score a perfect 10 for each, the bonus point will be 1 and will be added to the score for the exam). It is encouraged that you work together in groups of 2-4 people with complementary backgound and hand-in one homework.  Discussing the work in groups helps you learn, and helps the TA with the amount of grading.

The practice hour problems will require matlab or python (your choice), in order to also work at home it is helpful if you install matlab/python on your own computer. For matlab you need to follow the instructions of CNCZ so that you can use the site license.

I recorded lectures at home because of corona, these I have uploaded under Kaltura course gallery. They are meant to help you if you need to miss the lecture for some reason, or did not understand some part in the lecture itself and you want to review it, want to prepare for practice hours/exam. Typically I would lecture using the blackboard, but I have hand-written slides for the recorded lectures so I will use them for consistency. They are avaliable under content. Additionally, there are type-written lecture notes, this contains the same information, hence will help if you can not read my hand writing. These are also under content.  I would be happy to organize a question hour every week to go over the lecture (and to a lesser extent the practice hour), but there should be enough demand to do this. 

There is no exam scheduled — this is because since corona I have been asking students to write an essay wherein you answer questions (potentially also analytical/numerical) on a paper that I assign, for this you have 24 hours. I will post last year’s instructions so you can properly prepare. These  essays will be graded anonymously, so do not put your name in the file name or write-up itself. I am aware of the existence of ChatGPT: I expect you to write the essay yourself, but you can use tools (like chatGPT) to correct the language. 

The first lecture is on nov 6th. The first practice hour will be on nov 8th. 

What are my goals/expectations? I want you to acquire the skills necessary to formulate, implement computationally, solve, and interpret computational neuroscience problems given some neuroscience experimental data. The class is therefore challenging because it requires you apply a mix of analytical/mathematical & computational skills and neuroscience background, some of which might not yet be fully developed given your prior training. What I expect is that you engage in the lectures, try to do the practice hours, have fun doing it and seek help if your are experiencing problems — I am there for you.
